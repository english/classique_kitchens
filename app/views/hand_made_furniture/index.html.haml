          ### Carcass material
          We use the latest ranges from Egger and Kronospan of both melamine
          faced chipboard and "real wood" veneered MDF to give maximum choice and
          ensure a quality finish. If your client requires a co-ordinating or
          contrasting carcass for an individual look just ask. All carcasses are
          finished off using "real wood" edging to all raw edges.

          * * * * *

          ### Timber

          The majority of the timber used is handpicked to ensure it suits the
          specification entirely and that wherever possible the colour and
          grain runs through evenly. We are willing to use any timber necessary
          to suit the client's needs - oak, maple, walnut, ash, chestnut,
          sycamore, cherry, iroko etc...

          * * * * *

          ### Forest Stewardship Council
          We strive to use only those suppliers who adhere to the rules stipulated
          by the [FSC](http://www.fsc-uk.org/).
